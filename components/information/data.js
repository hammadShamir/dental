    tags: [`white smile `, `veneer`, `Teeth`, `Health`, `Hospital`, `Infection`],
    content: `

  <p>
  A beaming white smile isn’t something that has to be reserved for anyone.
  </p>

  <p>
  In fact, just about anyone with a bit of cash lying around can commit to getting porcelain veneers on
  their teeth for an effortless ivory shine.
  However, once you’ve jumped into this wonderful world, you’ll soon realize that you need to take
  care of these instant perfect teeth if you want to keep them looking good long-term. Not every dentist
  will give you the instructions for the after-care and maintenance that you might need, but at Milltown
  Dental, we make sure you know how to take care of your new veneers. Here are the top 5 tips for
  maintaining porcelain veneers
  </p>

 <h4>1. Don’t skip follow-ups</h4>
 <br>
  <p>
  Once you’ve completed your first new veneer placement it can be tempting to walk out and never
  return, ready to beam your smile at the world. However, there’s a reason a follow-up visit, scheduled
  usually for a week later, is important to attend.
  </p>

  <p>
  This is because there needs to be an evaluation of the treatment and to check if there have been
  any complications. While it can be annoying, this visit is of the utmost importance. It will allow the
  dentist to assess the placement of your porcelain veneers to ensure everything is going according to
  plan.
  </p>

  <p>More importantly, this will give you the opportunity to ask any questions or raise any concerns you
  may have experienced with your new veneers in the days since your treatment. This appointment
  will establish what maintenance is required to keep your upgraded TEETH LOOKING GOOD.</p>


  <h4>2. Ask any questions on your mind</h4>
  <br>
  <p>
  Say whatever you want to say and whatever’s on your mind.
  </p>

  <p>
  For instance, if you have concerns about any oral care habits you have or if you’re unsure about
  something, don’t hold back. Always ask the dentist to explain exactly what you need to do to
  preserve the veneers and to maintain your general oral health.
  </p>

  <p>Although the veneers are highly durable, they can be damaged - and it could be the kind of damage
  that’s incredibly costly to fix. However, if you ask the right questions and follow the dentist’s advice,
  as well as the tips here, you could have veneers that last for up to 20 years.</p>

  <p>Their dependability, functionality, and cosmetic beauty are really quite second to none, making them
  one of the best ways to easily improve your smile.</p>


  <h4>3. Continue oral health measures</h4>
  <br>
  <p>
  Just because you have sparkling new white encasings on top of your teeth doesn’t make proper
  health care any less important. In fact, good dental care may be more important than ever, as your
  veneer will need all the support it can get to stay shining as bright as the first day you get them.
  </p>

  <p>
  So, this brings us to the main point. Brush and floss your teeth every day exactly like you used to.
  Make sure to use non-abrasive fluoride toothpaste and prioritize your oral health.

  as well as the tips here, you could have veneers that last for up to 20 years.</p>

  <h4>4. Protect them from excessive grinding</h4>
  <p>A lot of people have the common problem of clenching or grinding their teeth too much. This can
  happen if you’re highly stressed, or anxious and tends to be a problem mostly when you’re sleeping.
  This is not good if you have porcelain veneers and the constant pressure and stress can cause
  damage to their shiny exterior.</p>

  <p>If you’re worried about this happening, or if you have a history of grinding teeth, make sure to tell
  your dentist. In fact, it’s possible to get a PROTECTIVE BITE GUARD that you can wear when you
  go to sleep that will help minimize these stresses and damages. So get fitted for one and walk out
  with everything you need to protect yourself and your investment.</p>

  <h4>5. Avoid dangerous foods</h4>
  <p>This is an unfortunate and somewhat restrictive impact of having veneers. You have to avoid food
  that would be damaging to them. Thankfully, this usually overlaps with food that would be bad for
  your natural teeth.</p>

  <p>For instance, don’t chew on ice or hard candy, as it could cause ugly-looking chips and cracks.</p>

  <p>However, on the flip side, things that stain your natural teeth like coffee, blueberries or food dyes are
  a lot less of a problem and shouldn’t adversely impact YOUR VENEERS. However, they can STAIN
  YOUR NATURAL TEETH, which might make a noticeable colour difference over time.</p>

  <h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>

<p>Remember that a smile won’t change your whole life but it could help you feel a lot more confident. A
beautiful smile is a great asset and being able to smile without worrying about the appearance of
your teeth, enhances your self-esteem and can improve the quality of your life.
By this point, you should have a pretty good idea of how porcelain veneers can deteriorate over time
and how you can ensure that this doesn’t happen. You don’t want to have to replace your expensive
veneers. However, even with the best advice, things can still go wrong. If this happens, just make an
appointment with Esthetix Dental.</p>

  <p>
  Almost everyone has had cavities, but very few know that they can be prevented by better nutrition, not just brushing and flossing adequately
  </p>

  <p>
  Eating a diet high in sugar or refined carbohydrates (white flour instead of whole grain, white sugar instead of alternatives like xylitol) results in the sticky particles clinging to teeth and becoming a bacterial film called plaque. This produces acid that eats away at the enamel of teeth and hardens into tartar, resulting in the peeling away of the gums supporting teeth until they fall out or need to be extracted. Eating a diet high in vegetables and whole foods with less sugar, coupled with brushing for two minutes after breakfast and dinner and flossing at night, can help prevent both cavities and periodontal disease. Carbonated sodas also eat away the enamel.
  </p>

  <p>Fortunately, vitamin and mineral supplementation can help teeth stay healthy. Most important is to take 1,500 mg. of calcium and 750 mg. of magnesium a day, an amount and ratio that play a vital role in making sure all bones (including teeth) are kept strong. Most Americans also do not get enough of the mineral potassium, which is an important part of bones and found in large amounts in leafy vegetables, beans, seeds, and salmon. A supplement of 3,500 mg. a day is recommended. Phosphorous is also an important mineral for teeth and bones, but most people get enough in their diet   </p>

  <p>Collagen is a protein that help hold all bones together. Powder or capsules can be taken, but even more effective is taking 5 mg. of the mineral silicon twice a day, because this prompts the body to internally form its own collagen, according to clinical studies</p>
 
 <p>Vitamin D is the most important vitamin for teeth health, which can be produced by the effect of the sun on skin. However, the lack of daily exposure by many and the difficulty for this happening for those with darker skin, result in the need for supplementation. Most physicians recommend 5,000 I.U.s a
 dayVitamin C can help prevent cavities and periodontal infections, but it is water soluble (it only stays in the blood for about five hours), so about 1,000 mg. should to be taken twice a day to maintain oral health.</p>
 
 <p>A multi-vitamin-mineral taken twice a day can be helpful, since all nutrients work together to keep us healthy, but the B vitamins that are a primary reason to take a multiple are also water soluble.</p>

        <h6>There are 4 main types of braces available today: </h6>

        <h3>Metal braces:</h3>
        <p>Metal or traditional braces are the most common type of braces world-wide. Metal braces are most popular among children and adolescent patients.<p/>

        
        <h3>Ceramic braces:</h3>
        <p>Ceramic braces are braces made of clear, tooth colored material. They work in the same way as metal braces, but are more discreet and less visible.<p/>


        
        <h3>Self-ligating braces:</h3>
        <p>Self-ligating braces work similarly to metal and ceramic braces and are available in metal or clear/ceramic material. We have found that self-ligating braces result in mildly shorter appointment times because of how easy they are to adjust.<p/>

        
        <h3>Lingual braces:</h3>
        <p>Lingual braces behind the teeth are especially well-suited for adults who do not want noticeable braces, but also have complex orthodontic needs. We have also seen an increase in the popularity of braces behind the teeth among esthetically conscious adolescents.<p/>

        Dental implants are medical devices surgically implanted into the jaw to restore a person's ability to chew or their appearance. They provide support for artificial (fake) teeth, such as crowns, bridges, or dentures.
        </p>
        <strong>Background</strong>
        <p>
        When a tooth is lost due to injury or disease, a person can experience complications such as rapid bone loss, defective speech, or changes to chewing patterns that result in discomfort. Replacing a lost tooth with a dental implant can significantly improve the patient's quality of life and health.
        </p>
        <p>
        Dental implant systems consist of a dental implant body and dental implant abutment and may also include an abutment fixation screw. The dental implant body is surgically inserted in the jawbone in place of the tooth's root. The dental implant abutment is usually attached to the implant body by the abutment fixation screw and extends through gums into the mouth to support the attached artificial teeth.

I would highly recommend Esthetix Dental Center to anyone in need of dental care in Dubai.
